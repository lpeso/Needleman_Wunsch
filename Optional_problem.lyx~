\begin_layout Title
Optional Python Review Exercise 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
This is an voluntary exercise that won't be marked nor it is part of your
 course grades.
 The aim of this exercise is to help you keep fresh your python programming
 skills.
 I will present you my solution to this problem as an excuse to review python
 concepts in the last class of the course.
 Keep in mind that this problem might prove to be more challenging than
 the ones we have already discussed during the course.
 Do not despair, you can solve it using the tools we have learned during
 the course and note that it is far more complex that the one you will have
 to solve for your final exam.

\begin_layout Paragraph
The goal is to write a pyhton3 script than implements the Needleman-Wunsch
 algorithm for sequence alignment.
 Although this may seem to be a daunting task, in fact it is quite easy
 if you have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

recipe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for this algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
I suggest you to use read the wikipedia entry for the Needleman-Wunch algorithm

\begin_layout Paragraph
In addition to a clear and detailed step-by-step explanation of the Needleman-Wu
nsch procedure, it also contains the 
\emph on
pseudocode
\emph default
 for the algorithm.
 A pseudo-code is a like a general template that contains the basic steps
 that any program needs to follow in order to produce the expected result
 (in this case the alignment of two sequences).
 The only thing you actually have to do is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

substitute

 the lines in this template with code for a specific language (in our case
 python3).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
You can also take a look at the excellent (an short!) paper

What is dynamic programming?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by Sean R.
 Eddy (NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY VOLUME 22 NUMBER 7 JULY 2004).
 This paper also provides an implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
 in C, so you can use it as an additional source of inspiration.
 I uploaded both, the paper and C code in the course Moodle page.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Finally, you can implement the algorithm as simple or complex as you wish
 (e.g.
 only aligns nucleotides with a fixed substitution matrix or allows for
 any kind of string and substitution matrix, provide fixed gap penalties
 or user-provided,...).
 In any case I would advise you to start writing the simplest possible code
 and then, if you wish, extent it.
 If you make this first version modular, you should be able to extend it
 quite easily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
We hope that, in addition to being useful for HPBBM, this assignment will
 help you gain a deeper understanding of sequence alignment and dynamic
 programming for your BIBMS course.
